This is the repository for Cesar and Hardhik's implementation of the ECE128 Lab 7 design. This lab consisted of 5 different module implementations: Moore FSM, Mealy FSM, Counter, Binary to BCD, and a top-level module combining all of these. For the design source, add the file that does not contain the "_tb" designation. For the simulation source, add the file that contains the "_tb" designation. Ensure the appropriate files are enabled and disabled for running synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation, and waveform generation. Analyzing the waveform of the testbenches will provide the most insight into the validity of the module designs. For the top-level module, ensure the design source and constraint file is added to the Vivado project.
